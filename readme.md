# Reflection

This project was created to implement the concepts previously learned in a more practical way and using real tools that we use on a daily basis, such as Redis, Mongo and etc ...

In this project, I'm applying the knowledge I learned and got through the course and applied them in a more theoretical way, even doing the event bus from scratch in this other project [Blog Microsservices](https://github.com/patrick0806/blog-microservices)
